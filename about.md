Props questions are drawn from [Mat Harrison](twitter.com/ExplosiveOutput)'s SB Props game - he'll be tweeting official answers under the hashtag [#MatsPropBetGame](https://twitter.com/search?q=%2523MatsPropBetGame) throughout the evening, and I'll round up answers from there sometime afterwards!

**ENTRY FEE** 

A (minimum) $5 donation to [GirlsWhoCode.com](https://GirlsWhoCode.com/donate), please post a receipt to the TDM #sb-props channel!

**PRIZE** 

One year of Discord Nitro and a special flair!

**OTHER RULES**

Proof of donation must be provided in order to qualify for prize. Multiple submissions allowed, I'll take the latest entry before kickoff. 

Good luck!
